## **üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS**

### **Immediate Blockers:**
1. **RLS Policy Application** - Manual step required in Supabase Dashboard
2. **AWS Agent Deployment** - Requires AWS CLI and credentials
3. **API Access** - Depends on external provider approvals

### **Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **RLS Policies:** Follow detailed guide, test in development first
2. **AWS Deployment:** Use existing AWS credentials, test locally first
3. **API Access:** Start with free tiers, use sandbox environments

---

## **üìä RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Technical Resources:**
- **Time:** 2-3 weeks full-time development
- **AWS Costs:** ~$50-100/month for agent infrastructure
- **API Costs:** Free tiers initially, then usage-based pricing

### **Business Resources:**
- **Legal Review:** For API terms and data sharing agreements
- **Partnership Development:** For revenue-sharing arrangements
- **Compliance:** For financial data access requirements

---

## **üí° KEY DECISIONS NEEDED**

### **Technical Decisions:**
1. **API Priority Order:** Which APIs to integrate first?
2. **Revenue Model:** Subscription vs. commission vs. freemium?
3. **User Limits:** How many products for free tier?

### **Business Decisions:**
1. **Pricing Strategy:** What to charge for premium features?
2. **Partnership Approach:** How to approach potential partners?
3. **Go-to-Market:** When to launch beta vs. full release?

---

## **üìû SUPPORT & ESCALATION**

### **Technical Issues:**
- Check documentation in project files
- Review error logs and debugging guides
- Test in development environment first

### **Business Issues:**
- Review partnership strategy documents
- Contact API provider developer relations
- Consider legal consultation for agreements

---

**üéØ This immediate action plan will complete the security fix and begin the transition to real API integration, moving Claimso from a proof-of-concept to a revenue-generating platform.**
